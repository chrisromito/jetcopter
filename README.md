# jetcopter

The autonomous, JS powered drone.  This project is no longer being developed in JS, and is now being written in Python.  I had to move from a Raspberry Pi to an ESP32 chip due to physical/performance limitations.  This project's predecessor is found [here](https://github.com/chrisromito/jetcopter-py).

However, this project still has good examples of how to:

- Write tests for Johnny-five.js components.  See: [copter_v2/test](https://github.com/chrisromito/jetcopter/tree/main/copter_v2/test) for examples
- Use functional reactive programming techniques in a high-throughput environment
- Server-side RxJs 
- Using Typescript/types to enforce correctness with respect to algebraic/physics equations.  See [copter_v2/src/physics](https://github.com/chrisromito/jetcopter/tree/main/copter_v2/src/physics)


See Docs, datasheets, diagrams, all of that good stuff in the documentation repo: https://github.com/chrisromito/jetcopter_docs
